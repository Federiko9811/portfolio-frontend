The classical pipeline, implemented using the **OpenIris library,** relies on Gabor filters for feature extraction and Hamming distance for matching. \n\nIn contrast, the deep learning model leverages a ResNet-50 architecture, generating feature embeddings and evaluating similarity using cosine metrics. Both methods were evaluated on the **CASIA-Iris-Thousand** dataset under identical conditions, highlighting the trade-offs between rule-based and data-driven techniques for biometric authentication.
