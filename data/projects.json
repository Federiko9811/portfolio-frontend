A key focus of our study was cross-dataset generalization—analyzing how well models trained on one dataset perform on unseen data. Using the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia), CheXpert, and RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge datasets, we tested model robustness in real-world scenarios.  \n\n\uD83D\uDD0D Key Takeaways:  \n\n✅ Traditional methods show stability across datasets but struggle with complex patterns.  \n✅ Deep learning models, especially ResNet50, achieve higher accuracy but are sensitive to dataset variability.  \n✅ Fine-tuning classification thresholds improves diagnostic performance.  \nOur findings offer valuable insights into selecting the best approach for AI-assisted pneumonia detection in clinical applications.
