In contrast, our deep learning model, based on ResNet-50, automatically learns feature embeddings and evaluates similarity.  \n\n\uD83D\uDCCA Key Takeaways:  \n\n✅ Traditional methods excel in structured environments with well-defined features.  \n✅ Deep learning provides greater adaptability to complex patterns and variations.  \n✅ Our evaluation on the CASIA-Iris-Thousand dataset highlights the strengths and trade-offs of each approach.  \n\nThis study provides insights into choosing the right approach for real-world biometric authentication systems. \uD83D\uDE80  \nWould love to hear your thoughts on the future of AI-powered biometrics!\n",
